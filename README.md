# Flux - a battery powered soldering station for Weller RT tips

This design is currently a work in progress, with the ultimate goal of being a portable soldering station utilising Weller RT tips. The design has two outputs, and will be powered off regular 18 or 36 V power tool lithium ion battery packs. It will support all RT tips from the RTP, RTM at RTU series.

## Current status

The basic design and schematic capture is done. A prototype board is being laid out, with the aim of being cheaply manufacturable (2 layers, 1 oz copper, smaller than 100 x 100 mm in size). From there, firmware will need to be written, and an enclosure will need to be modelled.
