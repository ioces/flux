# Flux - a battery powered soldering station for Weller RT tips

This design is currently a work in progress, with the ultimate goal of being a portable soldering station utilising Weller RT tips. The design has two outputs, and will be powered off regular 18 or 36 V power tool lithium ion battery packs. It will support all RT tips from the RTP, RTM at RTU series.
